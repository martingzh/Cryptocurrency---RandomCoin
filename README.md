# Cryptocurrency---RandomCoin
In this project, I try to code a server for a new type of cryptographic currency called RandomCoin. The premise is that users of this cryptocurrency attempt to guess a pre-set number, and if they succeed, they get a coin. 

This project is still a work in progress. This repository is more to document my learning experience about the inner mechanisms of cryptographic currency, than to serve as a useful currency to the general public.
